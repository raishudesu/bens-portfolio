        The process of conducting the study and how the we discovered the
        problems that correlates to mental health of the users through virtual
        interview and creating a persona that visualize their pain. It has been
        a journey on tackling the demands of the users and providing the needed
        answers/solutions.

        The goal of the project has been achieved when it comes in creating a
        functional virtual chatbot that answers to user&apos;s query and one of
        the main learning that we&apos;ve accumulated is how we understand the
        functionality of a chatbot, how the data goes in and out and how it
        varies in types of output and presenting them in line with the front end
        interface (HTML, CSS) this expands our current learning and giving focus
        in what is needed to be answered in a giving scenario/context one of the
        challenging step in creating this project is how the data would be
        allocated in the backend and how it would be outputted in the front end
        and the design on how it would look and this question keeps popping up
        in out mind: “Is this appealing for the users?”

        This study brought me the result of having to pursue on one topic and
        how to figure it out on my own and the possibilities of “What would
        happen next”. This study is rewarding because of what you learn on the
        process of doing it.
