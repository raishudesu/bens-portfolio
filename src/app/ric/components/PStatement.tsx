        The observed issues among IT students at Palawan State University
        pertain to their mental health and well-being. These problems are rooted
        in high stress levels, stemming from academic workloads, deadlines,
        personal life pressures, and unhealthy lifestyles, resulting in
        increased stress and anxiety. Additionally, a lack of awareness
        concerning their mental challenges leads some students to engage in
        destructive behaviors like addiction. Furthermore, limited access to
        professional mental health support due to financial constraints,
        reluctance to seek help, and the associated stigma further impedes IT
        students from accessing essential counseling and mental health services.
