        My journey when creating this project is hard. I experienced stress and
        anxiety when the time I can&apos;t think of something that would help us
        students in the future. But when I realized that most of us struggled in
        staying engaged in lectures and have trouble keeping up with coursework.
        I often found traditional studying methods boring and ineffective. I
        started to create a webpage that could help us students in our studies
        whenever or wherever we are, having to enjoy and at the same time learn
        while using my project which is Coursecrafters: A Quest for Knowledge. I
        aim that every student will excel significantly on their preferred
        course.

        The challenges I experience when I started doing the prototype are the
        elements and designs that I am going to put for my projects and the
        colors that I need. I picked Blue because it&apos;s one of the primary
        colors in the visible spectrum of light and is often described as a
        color that is soothing, calming, and serene. It is a fundamental element
        of our perception of the world and has many cultural and psychological
        associations. I&apos;m not yet done with this project and I&apos;m still
        waiting for feedbacks for me to use in my project, students&apos; mental
        health is also important to me so I&apos;m going to continue to upgrade
        my project.
