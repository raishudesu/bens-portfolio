  "Coursecrafters is a website offering a blend of trivia questions, fill-in-the-blanks, and multiple-choice quizzes designed to enhance students' knowledge in their chosen fields. Recognizing the academic stress students often face, I created an app that combines entertainment and education. The website's goal is to provide students with a study break that's both enjoyable and informative, even utilizing resources like OpenAI or ChatGPT for answering challenging questions. The app features three difficulty levels, offering students challenges and providing correct answers, thus supporting their studies anytime, anywhere.";

  "The observed issues among IT students at Palawan State University pertain to their mental health and well-being. These problems are rooted in high stress levels, stemming from academic workloads, deadlines, personal life pressures, and unhealthy lifestyles, resulting in increased stress and anxiety. Additionally, a lack of awareness concerning their mental challenges leads some students to engage in destructive behaviors like addiction. Furthermore, limited access to professional mental health support due to financial constraints, reluctance to seek help, and the associated stigma further impedes IT students from accessing essential counseling and mental health services.";
