  "Coursecrafters is a website offering a blend of trivia questions, fill-in-the-blanks, and multiple-choice quizzes designed to enhance students' knowledge in their chosen fields. Recognizing the academic stress students often face, I created an app that combines entertainment and education. The website's goal is to provide students with a study break that's both enjoyable and informative, even utilizing resources like OpenAI or ChatGPT for answering challenging questions. The app features three difficulty levels, offering students challenges and providing correct answers, thus supporting their studies anytime, anywhere.";
