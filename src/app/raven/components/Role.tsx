        Coursecrafters is a website offering a blend of trivia questions,
        fill-in-the-blanks, and multiple-choice quizzes designed to enhance
        students&apos; knowledge in their chosen fields. Recognizing the
        academic stress students often face, I created an app that combines
        entertainment and education. The website&apos;s goal is to provide
        students with a study break that&apos;s both enjoyable and informative,
        even utilizing resources like OpenAI or ChatGPT for answering
        challenging questions. The app features three difficulty levels,
        offering students challenges and providing correct answers, thus
        supporting their studies anytime, anywhere.
