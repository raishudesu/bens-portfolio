        The Palawan State University Dental Clinic currently operates on a
        first-come, first-served basis for student dental appointments,
        resulting in extended waiting times, uncertainty, and inefficiency. This
        approach hinders accessibility for students with varying schedules and
        has led to a preference among students for an online appointment system.
        Implementing such a system is expected to streamline the booking
        process, reduce physical queuing, and improve the overall clinic
        experience for students, making dental care more convenient and secure.
