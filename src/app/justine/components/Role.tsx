        This project centers on the creation of a digital dental appointment
        solution aimed at streamlining the process of booking dental
        appointments for students at Palawan State University. The existing
        manual appointment system often leads to extended waiting times and
        uncertainty about appointment availability, causing inconvenience for
        students. This project was developed to address these challenges, making
        it easy for students to schedule dental appointments online. The primary
        objective is to enhance the overall dental care experience for PSU
        students while improving the operational efficiency of the dental
        clinic. Through this project, I sought to provide a user-friendly
        solution that simplifies clinic visits and optimizes appointment
        management.
