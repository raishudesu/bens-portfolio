        The project&apos;s primary goal is to create a student community that
        fosters collaboration and support. Inspired by my college experience,
        where many IT students lacked direction, SITEX is a unified platform,
        drawing inspiration from platforms like Dev Community, GitHub, Stack
        Overflow, and ChatGPT. It offers features like digital learning
        materials, Q&A forums, knowledge sharing, and an AI chatbot to enhance
        learning and collaboration in various IT fields.
